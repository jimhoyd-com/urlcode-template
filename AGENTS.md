# Working on this project

This project uses URLCode: URL behavior is declared in `urlcode.yaml`, and the
installed `@jimhoyd/urlcode` runtime serves it. There is no framework code to
write for routing, validation, middleware wiring, policies, static serving or
authentication; the runtime provides them. Read this file before changing anything.

## Before writing code

1. Inspect `urlcode.yaml` first, then every file its `includes` list names,
   the referenced functions, middleware and `tests/requests.json`. Preserve the
   existing organization and every route you were not asked to change.
2. Run `urlcode capabilities` to see what this runtime version implements and
   which targets support it; `urlcode capabilities --target NAME` before
   promising any provider deployment.
3. Run `urlcode recipes list` and `urlcode recipes show NAME` before writing a
   route from scratch. If a recipe covers the need, add it with
   `urlcode recipes add NAME --out DIR` and adapt the copy.
4. Use URLCode's highest-level declarative features whenever possible. Generate custom code only when the framework cannot express the requirement. Check supported extensions and recipes first; explain any capability gap.

## Ask the runtime through MCP first

When present, `.mcp.json` registers the read-only `urlcode mcp` server. When it is
available, prefer its tools over reading documents: `get_context`,
`get_capability`, `get_schema`, `search_recipes`, `explain`, `get_manifest`.
The CLI equivalents are the fallback: `urlcode context`, `urlcode capabilities NAME`,
`urlcode schema PATH`, `urlcode recipes search TEXT`, `urlcode explain PATH`,
`urlcode manifest`. `--allow-authoring` is an operator opt-in; never add it yourself.

## What the runtime provides (this version)

- Handlers, exactly one per route: `redirect`, `respond`, `page`, `static`, `download`, `function`, `proxy`, `conditional`, `extension`.
- Ordered `middleware` around any handler, declared in YAML, running trusted
  and in-process unless the route declares `sandbox: true`.
- Validated inputs: `parameters`, `request.body` and `methods` on the route;
  functions receive validated `args`, never raw user input.
- Policies, host-enforced and off by default: `agents`, `throttle`, `cache`, `security`, `compression`.
- Site conventions under `site`, each generating one native route: `robots` (/robots.txt), `sitemap` (/sitemap.xml), `favicon` (/favicon.ico), `securityTxt` (/.well-known/security.txt), `llms` (/llms.txt).
- Bindings: named `env` and `secrets` references resolved by the operator, never values in YAML.

Never recreate any of these in a function. If a requirement seems to need one
of them and it is missing, that is a report, not an invitation to reimplement.

## Functions and middleware run trusted by default

Since core `0.4.0-alpha.2`, the version this project pins, `function` and
`middleware` routes run **trusted and in-process** by default: ordinary project
code with full Node access. `fetch`, the filesystem, timers and npm packages all
work. Write the code the requirement needs; do not refuse it or route it through
a `proxy` on the assumption that it is sandboxed.

`sandbox: true` is a per-route opt-in that moves that one route into an isolated
QuickJS/WASM worker, with a fresh heap per call. That route then sees only a
text/JSON `Request`/`Response` subset, validated `args` and granted `env` — no
`fetch`, no Node builtins, no filesystem, no npm, and relative ES-module imports
only. Do not add it reflexively: it costs worker-pool capacity and every one of
those capabilities. It is warranted when the route runs unreviewed or
third-party code, when it holds a secret whose blast radius matters, or when the
logic is complex enough that limiting a bug's reach is the margin you want.

"Trusted" describes the **authorship of the code** — first-party and reviewed —
not the request. All request data (path, query, headers, cookies, body,
webhooks) is untrusted in **both** modes and must always be validated.
`sandbox: true` is not input validation and not authentication.

## Checks that count as evidence

```sh
urlcode validate --local
urlcode test
urlcode audit --expect-routes 2
```

Run all three after every change. Update the expected route count deliberately
when you add or remove a route, and add fixtures to `tests/requests.json` for
every new route (positive and negative cases, every active method, HEAD).
Without a global install, invoke `node /path/to/urlcode/src/cli.ts` instead of `urlcode`.

## Rules

- Report unsupported requirements instead of inventing fields. The schema is
  exact; a field the validator rejects does not exist. Say what is missing.
- Never create or approve operator grants. Request a named binding in YAML and
  stop; the operator grants it outside this project, pinned to the revision.
- Secrets stay out of the project: no keys, tokens or credentials in YAML,
  functions, fixtures, `.env` files that are not ignored, or commit messages.
- Prefer supported authentication extensions and their documented configuration;
  never invent an `auth` field or duplicate functionality they provide.
- Validation, tests and the audit are the evidence. Local checks are not a
  deployment, a soak test or a security review; do not claim otherwise.

The installed package ships an agent skill with the same loop at
`skills/urlcode/SKILL.md` inside `@jimhoyd/urlcode` (for example
`node_modules/@jimhoyd/urlcode/skills/urlcode/SKILL.md`).
